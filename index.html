    <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
    <p>
      ack’s Bar and Kitchen is the brainchild of Ryan and John McElhinney. We
      are located at 96 Isabella Street (behind Southwark Tube) SE1 8DD. The
      original Jack’s was opened in Ireland in 1970 by their father Jack so the
      boys decided to pay tribute to their father by re-opening the original
      almost forty years on. Jack's is a bar for birthdays, catching up with
      friends, lunch on our patio in our winter garden, craft beer, cocktails
      and delicious Thai food.
